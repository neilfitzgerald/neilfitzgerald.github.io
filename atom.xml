    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Internationalizing your website or application is both easy, and hard. At the basic level it’s substituting in different strings and resources based on locale, but it gets much more complicated quickly.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>For example, an application I was dealing with was re-using many of its language keys. It turned out that verb tense in a page header needed to be different then in a dialog in russian. In english and many other languages the you could use the same phrase in both places. This example shows you can’t just assume that a direct translation can always be used in multiple places.</p>
<p>In another instance a website used a completely different design and authentic in Japan to gain significantly more traffic vs. the standard design used in other countries. In another case involving Japan, an issue for a website was only showing up when run on the localized version of the operating system.</p>
<p>In all localized applications or websites I’ve dealt with length of text was an issue. It’s common for a design that looks fine in english, but to have words overflow, or wrap in odd ways in other languages. This also impact the limits for data entry elements in the user interface. Usually you want to make sure the limit is high enough that it can accommodate locale specific needs. </p>
<p>Most languages are left to right languages. In these languages, things are scanned from the top left down to the right. Right to left languages and cultures like hebrew and arabic, are scanned from the top right and down to the left, requiring moving many user interface elements to truly localize. To add to the complication, you may have items that are left to right, embedded inside a right to left language. In a case I was involved with, we had to talk to someone who spoke and wrote the language to understand how it should behave.</p>
<p>Choices of colors, icons, and imagery can be impacted by locale. A particularly sensitive example for symbols is the swastika. In many countries it is a stigmatized symbol due to its association with Nazism. In India, where the symbol first appeared thousands of years ago, it is a sacred religious symbol. </p>
<p>Many of the technologies used today take care of the multi-byte nature of many languages. If something is being developed in a more low level language like C++, this may become more of a factor to look into.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a good process in place to get things translated. There is a need to factor in turnaround time, especially if you are using contract translators. With a good process, and proper review of your locale specific changes, your users around the world will have better experiences and your business better results.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Points"><a href="#Key-Points" class="headerlink" title="Key Points"></a>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Keep a lookout for items in the default language (usually english) when looking at other locales.</li>
<li>Use different keys for each location text appears.</li>
<li>Look at the user interface in the most highly verbose languages.<ul>
<li>Usually Germanic or Nordic languages have the longest words. Norwegian can be longer than German.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure colors are reviewed by a local. Colors can carry different associations depending on locale.</li>
<li>Make sure images, icons, and messaging are reviewed by a local. Some maybe offensive, or not carry the intended message for a locale.</li>

Management can make more informed decisions about the state of the software. Defects are less likely to make it to customers. <a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Honing the skills to find defects quickly is part of becoming a better tester. What was the complexity in the feature delivered? Who worked on the feature, and what are they likely to overlook? Are there cross-cutting concerns that are often overlooked? Where is the greatest risk? What has already been tested?</p>
<p>The naive approach is to look at the set of test cases and work your way through them one by one, top to bottom. Applying judgement to both select which test cases to execute first, and which are worth covering is part of what experience brings. </p>
<p>If a feature has been delivered for a web application, and the developer lets you know they have done a certain set of tests in Chrome, and your experience with the developer is they actually do the tests they say they did, you almost certainly want to start elsewhere with your testing. Start in another browser, and with test cases or more complex scenarios that they have not covered.</p>
<p>This more thoughtful approach will help you improve your personal process, and help you find bugs earlier. Observe what methods and approaches work best for you, apply them, and share.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The aesthetics (look and feel) and usability of a user facing application matter. Users will form perceptions about the software based on these factors. <a id="more"></a> An interface that looks good and feels good to interact with provides confidence to the user that your application is well built and suited to its task.</p>
<p>The aesthetics is important in the initial perception as users initially try out an application, and are using it at a superficial level. That initial experience will be important in make the emotional component of the decision making that will lead them to purchase or continue to use the application. It also helps shape the brand perception of the application. The aesthetics also tie into usability, in that they help guide the user to the parts of the user interface that they need for a particular task. </p>
<p>Usability is critical in enabling users to get their tasks done in an application. The challenge is often there are multiple audiences to make happy. What helps the basic user, may feel like a burden to the power user. Consistent user interactions speed the learning curve on an application, and help users know what to expect from an application. Leveraging existing user interface paradigms that users are familiar with also helps with this learning curve.</p>
<p>Both aesthetics and usability are important in the ongoing emotional relationship users have with an application. Is the application seen as easy to use? Is the application seen as a necessary evil to get the job done? Does is make the user’s life easier? Does the user feel good about using the application at the end of the day? Does the application fit with a user’s self identity?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Requirements for software of any complexity, are never complete. There are always unstated assumptions, edge cases, and ambiguities that will remain. <a id="more"></a> Time does not stand still, and things change. New requirements and rules emerge in the usual business of developing software and feedback from the users. </p>
<p>See my post on <a href="/2017/04/06/Document-to-the-Right-Level">Document to the Right Level</a> for more about thinking about how much to document.</p>
<p>Different strategies are appropriate depending on circumstances to learn more and to make decisions about requirements. Develop good judgement as to when to apply a strategy.</p>
<h2 id="Common-Strategies"><a href="#Common-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Common Strategies"></a>Common Strategies</h2><ul>
<li>Make a judgement call<ul>
<li>Sometimes just making a call as to how things should behave is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refer to standards<ul>
<li>Standards can provide good guidance on decision making. That standard can be one that has evolved specifically for that project, or an external one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to stakeholders<ul>
<li>Often there is a product owner who has deep knowledge of the users and the problem space. If there are cost implications in terms of time to implement, and maintainability, be sure to flag those to the stakeholders. Sometimes a less complete, or less elegant solution, will be the choice due to the costs of the more complex solution.</li>
<li>Be sure you know who the important stakeholders are that you need buy in from.</li>
<li>Learn the level of detail stakeholders want to be engaged at.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refer to similar solutions<ul>
<li>Competing or similar solutions may have set user expectations for how a feature should behave. This can be a good proxy to talking to actual users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to users<ul>
<li>Finding out what your users actually need and want by talking to them is often an effective method, but can be relatively expensive. Some interpretation is needed. Users often can’t state their feedback in a way that can be directly applied to a particular question.  </li>
<li>User feedback is most useful for incremental changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test user alternatives<ul>
<li>Testing alternative by putting them in front of real users is the ultimate check on the benefit and usability of alternatives. </li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Documentation of functionality or test cases is always imperfect. The trick is to do enough to serve your needs, and not waste effort on documentation that will never be used. <a id="more"></a> Specifications and requirements have a way of changing and getting out of date, that quickly makes them obsolete. The effort to go back and keep them up to date needs to be weighed against the benefit of moving on to the next thing. </p>
<p>Documenting what testing should be done, and what was done is an area that should be adjusted to the situation. Who is doing the testing? If you are outsourcing testing to unknown contractors, who have little familiarity with your application, you will need to document test cases in exquisite detail. If you are using a small team, of dedicated testers who quickly become experts in the application, the level of documentation can be much more high level. </p>
<p>What are the stakes involved in the software? Software that deals with financial, medical, nuclear situations will require much more rigorous process and documentation. Most businesses, can do with much less as speed of delivery is more important.</p>
<p>How complex is a specific piece of functionality? If it needs to operate by a set of complex rules and algorithms, than more documentation is warranted. If you are essentially cloning existing simple functionality, a simple reference to that maybe sufficient.</p>
<p>How large is your team? The bigger the team, the more will need to be documented to facilitate keeping the team on the same page.</p>
<p>For features, is there enough detail to implement as described? Can a developer quickly clarify any ambiguity? Does a developer have the authority to make decisions when there is ambiguity? Is there enough detail for a tester, to know what to test, and what is important?</p>
<p>When a developer is handing off a feature to be tested by others, is there enough information to know what and how to test? If the developer already tested some aspects of the feature, on specific platforms, is that communicated so that testers can focus on areas that might have been missed?</p>
<p>As you situation changes, you will need to adjust your level of detail to that required by the situation. Be aware of your own leanings of over or under documenting.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Point"><a href="#Key-Point" class="headerlink" title="Key Point"></a>Key Point</h2><ul>
<li>Use good judgement on how much time to invest in documentation. Cost in time must be weighed with other priorities, and the benefit of having the documentation.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Expand your effectiveness by learning to take multiple perspectives. This expands the number of possible solutions and options you have. <a id="more"></a>In testing, it will allow you to generate more test cases and possible ways to find problems. When problem solving it can open up new paths to different solutions.</p>
<p>For example, with software testing, one of the basic skills is to be able to generate a list of things to test (test cases). Most people can look at the straight forward functionality presented and figure out combinations of things to test based on the spelled out functionality. If you start looking at it from other angles you can find more. </p>
<p>From a technological perspective what technologies were used? For example knowing that it is a web application backed by a SQL database, that uses HTML and JavaScript on the front end opens up a set of things that could have been overlooked. If you put SQL into text entry fields does it get processes (SQL Injection). If you put characters that have special meaning in HTML into your text inputs, are they handled appropriately?</p>
<p>From a business perspective does the functionality fulfill the business needs of earning money at reasonable cost. If it costs money every time a particular service is called, or if you are not managing your machine instances in the cloud for cost, are you best serving your business? Do the features line up with marketing promises to customers? Are there competitors that you need to differentiate from, or match capabilities with? Will a feature make the business more likely to earn more or less money?</p>
<p>From the customer perspective, does the software allow you to accomplish the tasks you want to with the software? How hard it is to accomplish common tasks? What is going to annoy you? What is going to delight you?</p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, what people were involved in building the software? What are their blind spots? What mistakes do they tend to make? How do they approach problems?</p>
<p>There are more perspectives to take. By going deeper, beyond the first level of the obvious, you can more quickly identify problems, and consider additional solutions.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Point"><a href="#Key-Point" class="headerlink" title="Key Point"></a>Key Point</h2><ul>
<li>Being able to take multiple perspectives expands your effectiveness, by expanding the problem solving approaches available.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Repeatedly in my career, lack of attention to detail has lead to quality problems. As a result attention to details is one of the behaviors I pay a lot of attention to in developers.<a id="more"></a> </p>
<p>As with most things there is a spectrum, and some trade offs. One team I worked with had a wide spread of people on the spectrum of attention to detail. On one end was a developer who turned out lots of code, with little attention to detail. This developer had a 30% re-open rate for bugs / tickets (the highest rate on the team). I was always able to find a bunch of bugs in this person’s work whenever something was delivered. At the other end, their was a developer who turned out far less features, but was so careful that the re-open rate was 5%. It was always a struggle to find issues in this person’s work. Their is definitely a sweet spot between the two in terms of feature delivery in a timely manner, versus sufficient quality. That sweet spot is at different places depending on the context and goals of a project.</p>
<h2 id="Repeated-themes"><a href="#Repeated-themes" class="headerlink" title="Repeated themes"></a>Repeated themes</h2><p>A number of common themes come up with details being missed. Some of the often found repeated themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not addressing key user interaction in specifications</li>
<li>Not getting clarification on ambiguous detail in a specification</li>
<li>Skipping over key sentences in specifications or requirements</li>
<li>Only paying attention to the “happy path” through a use case</li>
<li>Missing changes required in related functionality</li>
<li>Skipping quality process steps - testing your own work, automated static code analysis, or code reviews</li>

      &lt;p&gt;Repeatedly in my career, lack of attention to detail has lead to quality problems. As a result attention to details is one of the behaviors I pay a lot of attention to in developers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the strategies I find myself returning to for testing is looking at the kinds of mistakes that are made. Often a pattern can be found. Individuals tend to make the same type of mistake over and over. <a id="more"></a>For groups, areas that are complex are repeatedly forgotten when the connection to the current change is not obvious. </p>
<p>There are many strategies to help counter this tendency to repeat mistakes. If the problem is common across the group a checklist can be very effective as a short term fix. If it’s particular to an individual, collaborating on a strategy that works for them often is effective.</p>
<p>It reflects on the maturity and experience of the developer on how open they are to feedback. A good developer is always looking to up their game. They will find ways change their process to reduce their errors. </p>
<p>The industry has already identified a number of of practices that can reduce errors, and have automated solutions. Unit testing and checking code coverage is one such practice. Static code analysis such as using a linter is another. Considering how a problem can be avoided by automating a process. </p>
<p>How software is designed can have a big impact on errors. Prefer designs that are simple, or require all parts to be properly updated for new functionality to be added.</p>

<li>Being mindful about why a mistake happened can lead to process or behavior changes that reduce the likelihood of the same type of mistake in the future.</li>

<p>I’m not a great writer. I tend to have poor transitions and leave things out. I use too many big words and long sentences. I’m working on it.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in the software industry for over 20 years. I’ve been around the block a bit. During that time I’ve had enough experiences with testing, software quality, and management to develop some thoughts on these topics. I plan to focus this blog mostly on these topics.</p>
<p>I’m constantly having to learn new technologies, and will likely will include some stuff on that too.</p>
<p>I’m into photography, kayaking and travel, go see my G+ for more of that. I took the picture that is used as the background on the about page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early in my career I worked for a company that tried to adopt the ISO 9000 standard to drive the software development process. I was already working on a disaster project, with both poor design and implementation. Rather than help correct course on the project the attempt to adopt the standard added to the chaos. <a id="more"></a>Progress on the project was already crawling, ground to almost a halt. The sign-off process required by the standard significantly slowed decision making and getting things done. Reams of write once, read never paperwork was generated. When an ISO 9000 auditor was brought in, the project manager generated lots of post facto records simply to comply with the standard and pass the audit.</p>
<p>All the work to comply with the standard resulted in negative quality results. All the projects in the department were delayed in delivery, with negative to no increase in quality. The paper work requirements proved to be an excessive burden for the quality goals for the projects in our department. The incentives as setup for the audit and standard did not generate a virtuous cycle of improvement, rather it created incentives to circumvent the process and emphasised compliance with the process, rather than doing what was right to deliver the projects meeting the delivery and quality goals of the company.</p>
<p>More recently I have worked for companies that have adopted aspects of agile processes. In general, the more the process is attempted to be applied cookie cutter as described in its idealized form, the less successful it tended to be. Agile process tends to be more successful, when practices are adopted when they make sense for a project, and with flexibility to adjust and adapt the practices to fit the character, development, and goals of a team.</p>
<h2 id="Key-learnings-about-process"><a href="#Key-learnings-about-process" class="headerlink" title="Key learnings about process:"></a>Key learnings about process:</h2><ul>
<li>Don’t do process for processes sake. A process is there to serve a purpose, not to be the purpose.</li>
<li>Don’t lose the point of a process.<ul>
<li>If you don’t know the why of the process, you don’t know if it’s really needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good process addresses and leverages human behavioral tendencies.<ul>
<li>Making the process the path of least resistance, it helps with adoption.</li>
<li>The longer the process and more complex the process the less likely people are to follow it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strive for tools that support the process.<ul>
<li>Make it easy</li>
<li>Make the process unnecessary</li>
