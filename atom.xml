<p>As with most things there is a spectrum, and some trade offs. One team I worked with had a wide spread of people on the spectrum of attention to detail. On one end was a developer who turned out lots of code, with little attention to detail. This developer had a 30% re-open rate for bugs / tickets (the highest rate on the team). I was always able to find a bunch of bugs in this person’s work whenever something was delivered. At the other end, their was a developer who turned out far less features, but was so careful that the re-open rate was 5%. It was always a struggle to find issues in this person’s work. Their is definitely a sweet spot between the two in terms of feature delivery in a timely manner, versus sufficient quality. That sweet spot is at different places depending on the context and goals of a project.</p>
<h2 id="Repeated-themes"><a href="#Repeated-themes" class="headerlink" title="Repeated themes"></a>Repeated themes</h2><p>A number of common themes come up with details being missed. Some of the often found repeated themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not addressing key user interaction in specifications</li>
<li>Not getting clarification on ambiguous detail in a specification</li>
<li>Skipping over key sentences in specifications or requirements</li>
<li>Only paying attention to the “happy path” through a use case</li>
<li>Missing changes required in related functionality</li>
<li>Skipping quality process steps - testing your own work, automated static code analysis, or code reviews</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Key-Points"><a href="#Key-Points" class="headerlink" title="Key Points"></a>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Mistakes are commonly made in the details</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the strategies I find myself returning to for testing is looking at the kinds of mistakes that are made. Often a pattern can be found. Individuals tend to make the same type of mistake over and over. <a id="more"></a>For groups, areas that are complex are repeatedly forgotten when the connection to the current change is not obvious. </p>
<p>There are many strategies to help counter this tendency to repeat mistakes. If the problem is common across the group a checklist can be very effective as a short term fix. If it’s particular to an individual, collaborating on a strategy that works for them often is effective.</p>
<p>It reflects on the maturity and experience of the developer on how open they are to feedback. A good developer is always looking to up their game. They will find ways change their process to reduce their errors. </p>
<p>The industry has already identified a number of of practices that can reduce errors, and have automated solutions. Unit testing and checking code coverage is one such practice. Static code analysis such as using a linter is another. Considering how a problem can be avoided by automating a process. </p>
<p>How software is designed can have a big impact on errors. Prefer designs that are simple, or require all parts to be properly updated for new functionality to be added.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Points"><a href="#Key-Points" class="headerlink" title="Key Points"></a>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Its human nature to make the same type of mistakes.</li>
<li>Being mindful about why a mistake happened can lead to process or behavior changes that reduce the likelihood of the same type of mistake in the future.</li>
<li>Some upfront thought to design, process, and tooling can help reduce mistakes during implementation and ongoing development.</li>

<p>I’m not a great writer. I tend to have poor transitions and leave things out. I use too many big words and long sentences. I’m working on it.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in the software industry for over 20 years. I’ve been around the block a bit. During that time I’ve had enough experiences with testing, software quality, and management to develop some thoughts on these topics. I plan to focus this blog mostly on these topics.</p>
<p>I’m constantly having to learn new technologies, and will likely will include some stuff on that too.</p>
<p>I’m into photography, kayaking and travel, go see my G+ for more of that. I took the picture that is used as the background on the about page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early in my career I worked for a company that tried to adopt the ISO 9000 standard to drive the software development process. I was already working on a disaster project, with both poor design and implementation. Rather than help correct course on the project the attempt to adopt the standard added to the chaos. <a id="more"></a>Progress on the project was already crawling, ground to almost a halt. The sign-off process required by the standard significantly slowed decision making and getting things done. Reams of write once, read never paperwork was generated. When an ISO 9000 auditor was brought in, the project manager generated lots of post facto records simply to comply with the standard and pass the audit.</p>
<p>All the work to comply with the standard resulted in negative quality results. All the projects in the department were delayed in delivery, with negative to no increase in quality. The paper work requirements proved to be an excessive burden for the quality goals for the projects in our department. The incentives as setup for the audit and standard did not generate a virtuous cycle of improvement, rather it created incentives to circumvent the process and emphasised compliance with the process, rather than doing what was right to deliver the projects meeting the delivery and quality goals of the company.</p>
<p>More recently I have worked for companies that have adopted aspects of agile processes. In general, the more the process is attempted to be applied cookie cutter as described in its idealized form, the less successful it tended to be. Agile process tends to be more successful, when practices are adopted when they make sense for a project, and with flexibility to adjust and adapt the practices to fit the character, development, and goals of a team.</p>
<h2 id="Key-learnings-about-process"><a href="#Key-learnings-about-process" class="headerlink" title="Key learnings about process:"></a>Key learnings about process:</h2><ul>
<li>Don’t do process for processes sake. A process is there to serve a purpose, not to be the purpose.</li>
<li>Don’t lose the point of a process.<ul>
<li>If you don’t know the why of the process, you don’t know if it’s really needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good process addresses and leverages human behavioral tendencies.<ul>
<li>Making the process the path of least resistance, it helps with adoption.</li>
<li>The longer the process and more complex the process the less likely people are to follow it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strive for tools that support the process.<ul>
<li>Make it easy</li>
<li>Make the process unnecessary</li>

<li>Just enough process to herd the cats, but no more.</li>
